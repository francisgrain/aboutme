<h2>Hi everybody, I am willing to collaborate on any project to grow professionally.</h2>
<p align="justify"> I'm a junior full-stack developer from Italy. ðŸ‘‹ 
                  Since my childhood, I've always been fond of computers and electronics. 
                  I'm a very creative person, and I love everything about technology. 
                  I also create, release, and distribute electronic music on my own. 
                  I mostly work with HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, TypeScript, 
                  Angular, OOP, Java, Python, Flask, SpringBoot, and Thymeleaf. 
                  You can find my code on my GitHub page below. 
                  I would be really happy to gain professional experience as a full-stack developer. 
                  I am open to any type of collaboration or proposals related 
                  to start-ups or projects of any kind. I am well aware that mastering 
                  even one of the languages mentioned above requires several years of experience. 
                  However, even though I am just starting out, I am very dedicated and curious, 
                  and I work hard every day to learn new topics. 
                  I would be happy to challenge myself.
